Code for the paper [Domain-shift adaptation with linear transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05282)

This repository contains three main elements:
- **MLib:** An in-house developed library that contains the implementation of Algorithms 1 and 2 in the paper, as well as auxiliary functions required to reproduce our main results.
- **Simulations.ipynb:** A jupyter notebook with the code to reproduce the simulated experiments.
- **BinaryDigits.ipynb:** A jupyter notebook with the code to reproduce our results with MNIST dataset.
